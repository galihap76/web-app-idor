I am building this for the purpose of education on web application security regarding IDOR vulnerabilities. Let's assume that the web application I am creating has an IDOR vulnerability in its design, and the reason for this is to simulate the exploitation of an IDOR vulnerability.

I have developed an IDOR exploit using the Python programming language to facilitate attacks on the web application. It is important to remember once again that this is solely a simulation of IDOR vulnerability exploitation and serves the purpose of education about web application security.
